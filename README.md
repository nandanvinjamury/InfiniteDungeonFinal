Once you download the zip file, right click, click extract all, then click extract. 

Inside the files, you should see three key folders: InfiniteDungeon, Scripts, and TestGeneration. 

The first is the game, with full playability using a keyboard and mouse.

You only need to open the executable file named “Infinite Dungeon” with an icon of a cracked gray tile.

There is a dialogue cutscene initially which can be entirely skipped by pressing s.

wasd to move in game, mouse click to shoot.

Besides that, there are quit buttons on the menu and game over screen, but no way to quit mid game. 

I would recommend pressing Alt+F4 to quit or to die, then press the quit button. 

There is no actual end to the game until you die, since clearing all enemies restarts the level with a different procedural dungeon layout. 

The final folder, test generation, is useful for being able to see the entire dungeon layout maps without gameplay. 

It also has an executable file “Infinite Dungeon” with a cracked gray tile, but the program is not the same as the first folder, even though they look like it.

Once you click play to start, the retry layout button attempts to reorganize the same rooms in a different order/layout if possible. 

If you look at a room with a peculiar size, you can usually follow where it is when clicking the retry layout button. Otherwise, the new layout button discards the current layout and generates a new one.
