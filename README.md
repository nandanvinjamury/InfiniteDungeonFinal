# Infinite Dungeon (Windows Build)

> A procedural dungeon generator made in Unity

## Installation

Download the repository as a zip file and extract its contents. 

You should see three key folders inside: 
1. InfiniteDungeon
2. Scripts
3. TestGeneration

## 1. Infinite Dungeon

The first is the game, with full playability using a keyboard and mouse. 

You only need to open the executable file named “Infinite Dungeon” with an icon of a cracked gray tile.

There is a dialogue cutscene initially which can be entirely skipped by pressing `S`.

`W,A,S,D` are used to move in game, `left click` to shoot.

Press `Alt+F4` to exit. 

There is no actual end to the game until you die, since clearing all enemies restarts the level with a different procedural dungeon layout. 

## 2. Scripts

This folder contains the scripts that I wrote for the procedural generation in this game.

## 3. Test Generation

The final folder is useful for being able to see the entire dungeon layout maps without gameplay. 

It also has an executable file “Infinite Dungeon” with a cracked gray tile, but the program is not the same as the first folder.

Once you click play to start, the retry layout button attempts to reorganize the same rooms in a different order/layout if possible. 

If you look at a room with a peculiar size, you can usually follow where it is when clicking the retry layout button. 

Otherwise, the new layout button discards the current layout and generates a new one.
